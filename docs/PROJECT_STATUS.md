# Azure Trading System - Project Status

## What Has Been Done
- Migrated from Python to a modular C# solution for Azure, with projects for core models, ingestion, analysis, backtesting, web dashboard, and tests.
- Implemented robust, high-throughput data ingestion from Polygon.io using Websocket.Client, with concurrent queues, background workers, and event-driven processing.
- Added downstream consumers for Redis caching and analysis, with batching and error handling, all configurable via appsettings.json.
- Integrated Azure Data Explorer (ADX) for historical data storage, with batch ingestion, error handling, and all features/resource usage configurable.
- Created a separate, isolated backtesting console app, reusing core models and analysis logic, supporting trade simulation, advanced metrics, parameter sweeps, and export to CSV/JSON/HTML.
- Added a dead letter queue for failed trades and made all advanced features configurable.
- Refactored the backtest runner to use real technical analysis and signal generation services.
- Scaffolded a minimal web dashboard using Plotly.js for interactive reporting and analytics.
- Added robust retry logic and a dead-letter queue for ADX ingestion failures.
- Added endpoints and dashboard integration for ADX analytics and live analytics (with a placeholder for now).
- Upgraded/downgraded all projects to .NET 8.0 for compatibility with the Kusto SDK.
- Fixed project references and NuGet package issues.

## Current State
- All projects target .NET 8.0 and build successfully (pending reboot to resolve a rare Kusto SDK build issue).
- Data ingestion, analysis, backtesting, and dashboard modules are implemented and integrated.
- ADX ingestion and querying are implemented, with retry and dead-letter support.
- The dashboard displays backtest results, ADX analytics, and live analytics (placeholder).
- Project is ready for GitHub initialization and Azure deployment after confirming build stability.

## Next Steps
1. **Reboot the machine** to resolve any lingering build or cache issues.
2. **Test the build** and run the dashboard to confirm all features work end-to-end.
3. **Initialize a GitHub repository** and push the codebase.
4. **Wire up real live analytics** (e.g., from Redis or in-memory metrics) in the AnalyticsController and dashboard.
5. **Deploy the solution to Azure** (App Service, Container Apps, or VMs as appropriate).
6. **(Optional) Add more advanced analytics, reporting, and dashboard features** as needed.
