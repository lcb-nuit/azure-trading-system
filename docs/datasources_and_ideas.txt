Can you list the websocket endpoint each item comes from?
1. Volume Analysis (from Aggregates)
Decreasing volume on red candles + Increasing volume on green candles
Track v (volume) with c (close) vs o (open)
If down moves have progressively less volume = sellers exhausted
If small bounces have increasing volume = buyers stepping in
2. Price Action Patterns (from Minute/Second Aggregates)
Higher lows forming despite downtrend
Compare sequential l (low) values
Each pullback bottoms at higher price = support building
Smaller red candles over time = selling pressure weakening
3. RSI Divergence (from RSI endpoint)
Price makes new low but RSI makes higher low
When RSI is 30-40 while price drops = oversold bounce likely
RSI climbing while price flat/down = momentum shifting
4. MACD Convergence (from MACD endpoint)
MACD line approaching signal line from below
Histogram bars getting smaller = momentum slowing
MACD curling up = potential reversal
5. Bid/Ask Dynamics (from Quotes WebSocket)
Bid size increasing while ask size decreasing during downtrend
Growing bid support = buyers accumulating
Shrinking ask pressure = sellers exhausted
Spread tightening = equilibrium near
