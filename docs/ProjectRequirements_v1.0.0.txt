Azure Trading System Requirements Document
Executive Summary
A real-time stock trading system that monitors NASDAQ stocks during pre-market hours (5:30-8:30 AM EST), identifies trading opportunities through a four-tier filtering system, and provides actionable entry/exit signals for day trading.
System Overview
Core Concept
The system operates as a funnel, progressively filtering thousands of stocks down to a handful of high-probability trading opportunities. It processes real-time market data, applies technical analysis, and detects momentum shifts based on volume and price action patterns.
Trading Philosophy

Focus on pre-market momentum plays
Exploit crowd psychology in high-volume situations
	All configurable metrics.
	- 5x relative volume from the low 20 sma on the day.
	- An absolution metric such as 30k trades per minute
	- Volume spikes where the volume more than doubles from the previous candle

Capitalize on the inertia of large buyer/seller groups
Target 2-5% gains per trade with strict risk management

Functional Requirements
1. Data Ingestion & Processing
1.1 Market Data Source

Connect to Polygon.io WebSocket for real-time market data
Support both delayed (free) and real-time (paid) data feeds
Handle multiple data types: aggregates, trades, quotes, and order book data

1.2 Operating Hours

Active trading window: 4:00 AM - 8:30 AM EST
Automatic startup at 3:45 AM for system initialization
Graceful shutdown at 8:35 AM with data persistence

1.3 Data Storage Strategy

Real-time cache for current market state and calculations
Time-series database for historical analysis and pattern detection
Configurable data retention policies based on tier classification

2. Four-Tier Analysis System
Tier 1: Universe Selection
Purpose: Create initial watchlist from entire NASDAQ
Filters:

Price range: $0.30 - $10.00 (configurable)
Float: Less than 40 million shares (configurable)
Minimum average volume thresholds

Data Collection:

Refresh universe every 10 minutes
Store: ticker, price, volume, high, low, close, float
Data granularity: 1-minute bars (configurable down to 1 second)

Output: List of 200-500 stocks meeting basic criteria
Tier 2: Activity Detection
Purpose: Identify stocks showing unusual activity
Detection Criteria:

Create a framework that can apply multiple rules
Volume spike rule examples: 
	3x normal volume (20 sma)
	OR 2x or more voume rise from the previous candle.
	OR 3x or more volume rise in any 3 candle timeframe.
	OR Volume per minute equates to 20,000 or more.
Stochastic Rule Examples
	All below 20, any line jumps by 10 or more with 20k in volume - ENTER
	All 3 jump by 20 or more - enter
	All 2 of 3 Jump by 20 or more with volume - ENTER
	All trades must follow a 60 point dip in the last 3 candles.
Make Room for other types of rules as well.
Price movement indicators
News catalyst correlation

Monitoring:

Check every minute for volume anomalies
Compare against 10-day average baselines
Flag stocks meeting 2+ activity criteria

Output: 20-50 stocks showing significant activity

Exit signals for profit taking or stop loss
Position sizing recommendations

Risk Management:

Maximum position size limits
Stop loss calculations
Profit target identification
